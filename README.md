# sudoku solver

This is a C++ program to solve a sudoku board using backtracking.
The program is set to solve a 9x9 board by default, but can solve 3x3 or 6x6 etc. boards as well by changing the number_of_rows integer in the program.

## How to use

Compile and run the project file, which will create a .txt file called sudoku_board in the same directory. Open this file and fill the board, and press enter to solve.
